**SCORING PHILOSOPHY:**

FOR GENERAL QA DIMENSIONS (#1-8: Rapport, Needs Discovery, Product Knowledge, Objection Handling, Closing, Compliance, Professionalism, Follow-Up):
- **8/10 is the EXPECTED STANDARD** for a competent agent doing their job properly
- **Only score below 8** if there is SPECIFIC, CLEAR evidence of a gap or deficiency
- **Be generous** - if the agent is performing their role adequately, they deserve 8/10
- **9/10** = Agent exceeds expectations in meaningful ways (e.g., exceptional empathy, creative problem-solving, builds outstanding rapport)
- **10/10** = Exemplary, best-in-class performance that should be used as a training example
- **7/10** = Noticeable gap that needs coaching (e.g., missed opportunity, awkward phrasing, incomplete explanation)
- **6/10 or below** = Significant performance issue requiring immediate attention

**IMPORTANT**: For scores 7-9, ALWAYS include specific "Path to Excellence" guidance showing:
- What the agent did well
- Exactly what would elevate them to the next score level
- A concrete example script or action

FOR UK COMPLIANCE DIMENSIONS (#9-14):
- **10/10 = FULL COMPLIANCE** - all regulatory requirements met
- **9/10** = Fully compliant with very minor process improvements possible
- **8/10** = Compliant with minor gaps that don't breach regulations
- **7/10 or below** = Compliance gap or regulatory breach requiring immediate remediation
- **Be strict but fair** - compliance is non-negotiable, but interpret regulations practically
- Only flag actual breaches, not overly pedantic interpretations

Please analyze this call across the following dimensions, scoring each from 0-10:

**CORE QA DIMENSIONS (7 dimensions):**

1. **Rapport Building** (rapport): How well did the agent establish connection and trust with the customer?
   - 8-10: Excellent rapport, warm and personable, builds strong connection
   - 5-7: Adequate rapport, professional but somewhat distant
   - 0-4: Poor rapport, cold or impersonal interaction

2. **Needs Discovery** (needsDiscovery): How effectively did the agent identify customer needs and pain points?
   - 8-10: Thorough discovery, asked probing questions, uncovered key needs
   - 5-7: Basic discovery, identified some needs but missed opportunities
   - 0-4: Poor discovery, failed to understand customer needs

3. **Product Knowledge** (productKnowledge): How well did the agent demonstrate understanding of products/services?
   - 8-10: Expert knowledge, confident explanations, handled complex questions
   - 5-7: Adequate knowledge, answered most questions correctly
   - 0-4: Poor knowledge, gave incorrect or incomplete information

4. **Objection Handling** (objectionHandling): How effectively did the agent address concerns and objections?
   - **DEFAULT: 8/10 if NO objections raised** - This is the expected baseline (customer satisfied, no concerns voiced)
   - **ONLY deduct points if objections WERE raised and mishandled:**
     - 9-10: Excellent handling, addressed concerns thoroughly, turned objections into opportunities
     - 7-8: Adequate handling, addressed concerns but lacked confidence or missed opportunity to strengthen value
     - 5-6: Weak handling, avoided or incompletely addressed objections
     - 0-4: Poor handling, dismissed objections or became defensive
   - **If no objections raised, score 8/10** unless there's evidence the agent should have proactively addressed concerns

5. **Closing Techniques** (closing): How well did the agent move toward a resolution or next step?
   - 8-10: Strong close, clear next steps, gained commitment
   - 5-7: Adequate close, some next steps but lacked clarity
   - 0-4: Weak or no close, left customer uncertain

6. **Professionalism** (professionalism): How professional was the agent's communication and demeanor?
   - 8-10: Highly professional, polished communication, appropriate tone
   - 5-7: Adequately professional, occasional lapses
   - 0-4: Unprofessional behavior or communication

7. **Follow-Up** (followUp): How well did the agent set expectations for next steps and follow-up?
   - 8-10: Clear follow-up plan, documented action items, set expectations
   - 5-7: Basic follow-up, some next steps mentioned
   - 0-4: No follow-up plan or unclear next steps

**UK COMPLIANCE DIMENSIONS** (Critical for regulatory adherence - scored separately from QA dimensions):

8. **Call Opening Compliance** (callOpeningCompliance): 0-10
   - 10: Perfect - All required elements present for this call type
   - 9: Fully compliant with minor procedural enhancement possible

**CALL TYPE IDENTIFICATION:**
First, identify the primary call type:
1. NEW BUSINESS SALES - Customer purchasing new insurance
2. RENEWALS - Customer renewing existing policy
3. MID-TERM ADJUSTMENT (MTA) - Changes to existing policy
4. CLAIMS INQUIRY / FNOL - Customer calling about a claim
5. COMPLAINTS - Customer making a formal complaint
6. GENERAL INQUIRY - Information requests, policy servicing

**IMPORTANT - SCORING CALCULATION:**
- **DO NOT calculate or return overallScore** - We will calculate this separately as a weighted average
- **Score all 7 core QA dimensions** (rapport through followUp)
- **Score all 6 UK compliance dimensions** (callOpeningCompliance through complaintsHandling)
- The system will automatically calculate:
  - **QA Score**: Average of 7 core QA dimensions
  - **Compliance Score**: Average of applicable UK compliance dimensions (excluding nulls)
  - **Overall Score**: Weighted average (70% QA + 30% Compliance)

Additionally, identify:
- **Call Type**: Identify and return as callType field (one of: "new_business_sales", "renewals", "mid_term_adjustment", "claims_inquiry", "complaints", "general_inquiry")
- **Key Moments**: 10-15 specific moments spread across ALL dimensions INCLUDING the UK compliance dimensions. Each moment must:
  - Include the exact dimension category (rapport, needsDiscovery, productKnowledge, objectionHandling, closing, professionalism, followUp, callOpeningCompliance, dataProtectionCompliance, mandatoryDisclosures, tcfCompliance, salesProcessCompliance, complaintsHandling)
  - Have a precise timestamp in seconds matching the transcript
  - **CRITICAL**: Include an EXACT, VERBATIM quote copied directly from the transcript - DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or infer dialogue
  - The quote must be a direct copy-paste from the transcript text, not a summary or interpretation
  - If you cannot find an exact quote, skip that moment rather than inventing dialogue
  - Be marked as positive, negative, or neutral
  - Provide context for why this moment matters for that dimension
  - **COMPLIANCE MOMENTS REQUIRED**: At LEAST 2 moments must be compliance-related (from the 6 UK compliance sub-dimensions)
  - Flag critical compliance breaches as NEGATIVE moments
  - Highlight excellent compliance practices as POSITIVE moments
- **Call Outcome**: Brief description of how the call ended (e.g., "Sale closed", "Follow-up scheduled", "Customer declined")
- **Outcome Metrics**: Quantifiable outcomes from the call:
  - quotesCompleted: Number of insurance quotes provided (0, 1, 2, etc.)
  - salesCompleted: Number of policies sold (0 or 1)
  - renewalsCompleted: Number of policy renewals completed (0 or 1)
- **Coaching Recommendations**: 3-5 specific, actionable coaching points for the agent (prioritize compliance issues first)

  **IMPORTANT - "Path to Excellence" for scores 7-9**:
  For ANY dimension scored 7, 8, or 9, you MUST include coaching that explains:
  - What the agent did well in this area
  - Exactly what would elevate them to the next score level (e.g., from 7→8, 8→9, 9→10)
  - A concrete example script or action they can take

  Example coaching for 8/10 Rapport:
  "Great job building rapport by using the customer's name and showing empathy. To reach 9/10, try incorporating more personalized conversation based on the customer's specific situation. For example: 'I can hear that having reliable cover for your business is really important to you, especially with your expansion plans. Let me make sure we get this exactly right for you.'"
- **Compliance Issues**: Any compliance violations or concerns. For each issue provide:
  - severity: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low"
  - category: Which compliance sub-dimension (e.g., "dataProtectionCompliance", "mandatoryDisclosures")
  - issue: Clear description of the violation
  - regulatoryReference: Which regulation was breached (e.g., "ICOBS 4.2.1R", "GDPR Article 13", "FCA PRIN 6")
  - timestamp: When the issue occurred in seconds (null if not timestamp-specific)
  - remediation: **ENHANCED FORMAT** - Provide detailed remediation in this structure:
    * **What the law requires**: Quote or paraphrase the exact legal requirement
    * **What to say**: Provide a compliant script example the agent should use
    * **Why it matters**: Brief explanation of the customer protection this provides

    Example remediation format:
    "GDPR Article 13 requires a privacy notice at first contact. Agent must state: 'We collect and process your personal data for insurance purposes. You have the right to access, correct, or delete your data. For our full privacy policy, visit [website] or ask us to send it by post.' This ensures customers understand their data rights before sharing sensitive information."

  **Severity Definitions**:
  - CRITICAL: Regulatory breach with high risk (e.g., no DPA verification before accessing data, pressure selling, misleading information, complaint discouraged)
  - HIGH: Significant compliance gap (e.g., missing mandatory disclosures, no cooling-off rights explained, inadequate needs assessment)
  - MEDIUM: Procedural gap (e.g., incomplete needs discovery, unclear pricing breakdown)
  - LOW: Best practice opportunity (e.g., could explain product features more clearly)

  Return empty array [] if NO compliance issues found.
- **Summary**: 2-3 sentence overall summary of the call
