# Task ID: 22
# Title: Evaluate and Recommend Optimal Speaker Diarization Solution for Insurance QA System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of leading speaker diarization solutions for insurance sales call QA, comparing accuracy, cost, integration, and compliance, and recommend the best fit for >95% speaker attribution accuracy.
# Details:
1. **Define Evaluation Criteria:**
   - Diarization Error Rate (DER) for 2-speaker scenarios (target: >95% attribution accuracy)
   - Cost structure (per hour/minute, monthly estimate for 100 calls × 8 min)
   - API integration complexity and compatibility with existing Whisper-based transcription
   - Processing speed (real-time or batch, latency)
   - Performance in noisy environments, overlapping speech, and short utterances
   - Support for UK English accents
   - Availability of speaker embeddings/voice fingerprints
   - Deployment options (cloud vs on-premise)
   - GDPR and UK insurance compliance

2. **Research and Compare Solutions:**
   - Evaluate AssemblyAI, Deepgram, Speechmatics, Gladia (Whisper+Pyannote), Pyannote Audio, Rev.ai, Azure Speech Services, and others as relevant[1][2][4][9].
   - Collect latest DER benchmarks, especially for noisy, overlapping, and short-utterance scenarios[1][9].
   - Document pricing models and estimate monthly costs for projected call volume.
   - Assess API documentation, SDKs, and ease of integration with current Whisper pipeline (can diarization be added post-transcription, or is full replacement needed?)[1].
   - Identify which solutions offer speaker embeddings/voice fingerprints and their utility for agent/customer identification.
   - Review deployment models and compliance certifications (SOC2, GDPR, UK-specific requirements)[1][2][4].

3. **Implementation Feasibility:**
   - For top 2-3 candidates, outline integration approach: keep Whisper for transcription and add diarization, or replace with all-in-one solution.
   - Rate implementation complexity (1-5 scale) based on API, SDK, and infrastructure requirements.
   - Identify risks of speaker misattribution and mitigation strategies (e.g., manual review, confidence thresholds).

4. **Recommendation Report:**
   - Summarize findings in a comparison table (DER, cost, speed, compliance, integration, deployment, UK accent support).
   - Recommend the optimal solution with rationale, estimated accuracy improvement over current heuristics, monthly cost, and risk assessment.
   - Provide a high-level integration plan and next steps for pilot implementation.

**Best practices:**
- Use recent (2024-2025) benchmarks and vendor documentation.
- Engage with vendor support for clarifications on compliance and deployment.
- Consider open-source (Pyannote) for maximum control, but weigh against maintenance and support needs.
- Ensure all recommendations are defensible for HR/legal review and compliance audits.

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate that the evaluation covers all required criteria (accuracy, cost, integration, compliance, etc.) for each shortlisted solution.
2. Confirm that DER and accuracy metrics are sourced from recent (2024-2025) benchmarks and are relevant to 2-speaker, noisy, and short-utterance scenarios.
3. Review cost calculations for accuracy based on current vendor pricing and projected call volume.
4. Ensure the recommendation includes a clear rationale, estimated accuracy improvement, cost, implementation complexity, and risk assessment.
5. Peer review the report for completeness, clarity, and actionable next steps.
6. Present findings to stakeholders (QA, compliance, engineering) for feedback and sign-off.
