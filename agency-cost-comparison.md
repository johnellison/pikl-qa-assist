## The Numbers

| Metric | Pikl's Cost | Agency Cost | Savings |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Development** | £6,000 | £55,000 - £65,000 | **£49,000 - £59,000** |
| **Timeline** | 5 days | 10-12 weeks | **9-11 weeks faster** |
| **Team Size** | 1 + AI | 3 people | Leaner execution |
| **Cost per day** | £1,200 | £4,400 - £5,200 | **73-77% cheaper** |

### ROI Summary

**Cost Savings: 89-91%**
- Built for **£6,000** vs agency quote of **£60,000**
- Saved **£54,000** on initial development
- Delivered in **11% of the time** (5 days vs 11 weeks)

## What Enabled This?

### AI-Native Development Approach
1. **Claude Code** - AI pair programming for rapid development
2. **Modern Stack** - Next.js 16, TypeScript, Shadcn/ui components
3. **AI APIs** - AssemblyAI + Anthropic Claude (vs building from scratch)
4. **Smart Tooling** - Leveraged pre-built infrastructure

### Why Traditional Agencies Can't Match This
- Process overhead (meetings, approvals, handoffs)
- Hourly billing model (incentivized to bill more hours)
- Multiple team members (communication overhead)
- Not fully leveraging AI coding tools (risk aversion, IP concerns)
- Capturing AI productivity gains as profit (not passing to clients)

---

## Key Takeaway

**The 2025 software development landscape has fundamentally changed.**

With AI coding tools, a skilled developer can deliver agency-quality work in a fraction of the time and cost - but most agencies haven't adjusted their pricing to reflect this new reality.

**Pikl captured £54K in savings by embracing AI-native development.**
